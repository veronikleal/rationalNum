Rational Numbers

Create a Rational number class in the same style as the Complex number class created in class. That is, implement the following methods:

constructor
add
sub
mul
div
toString


Main Project 4
Re-implement the Rational class

Extend the Number class and implement the Comparable interface to
introduce new functionality to your Rational class. The class
definition should look like this:

public class Rational extends Number implements Comparable<Rational> {

    // code goes here
}
        
In addition a new private method gcd should be
defined to ensure that the number is always represented in
the lowest terms.

Here is the Main  Download Main class that I will use to test your Rational classes. Remember to only submit the Rational.java file!
